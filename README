This allows copy/paste from one vim session to another outside of a window manager. In my case, I have muliple PuTTY windows, each running screen, where many screens have an instance of vim.

Provides two convenience commands: `TmpClipWrite` and `TmpClipRead` which work with the default (") register. Implementing functions are `tmpClipWrite` and `tmpClipRead` which accept the register as an argument.

Sample usage:

  Vim instance #1 (source)
    
    yy                - Yank [copy] the current line
    :TmpClipWrite     - Write it to ~/.tmpclip

  Vim instance #2 (destination)

    :TmpClipRead      - Read ~/.tmpclip
    p                 - Put [paste] it
